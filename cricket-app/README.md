## How to get the list of players?

The list of Cricketers can be accessed from files [get-players.ts](https://github.com/nirmata/front-end-assigments/blob/main/get-players.ts) or [get-players.js](https://github.com/nirmata/front-end-assigments/blob/main/get-players.js). These files export a method which resolves a promise and returns the list of players.

## What tech stack to be used?

- React JS 16+
- The app can be setup using tools like CreateReactApp, Vite etc
- Bootstrap/AntD/MaterialUI or any other UI library

This is a minimum tech stack. You are free to add other stacks, like Icons, Styling etc.

## What gives bonus points?

- Typescript
- Unit tests

## What is assessed?

- Complete implementation of the requirements, ideally 100%
- Coding principals used
- Components/hooks structure
- Cleanliness of the code
- Appearance & aesthetics
- The commit messages: We believe in reading git commit messages first before reviewing the code. This helps us understand how the code got matured and your thought process behind it.

## Remember

- The exercise is expected to be a Web Application
- The exercise needs to be done on ReactJS stack
- The web application must run without any errors
- Provide clear instructions to run the web application
- There are no time limits defined to complete the exercise. But you must note how much time you spent on it to complete it and mention that time when you submit it. But, we expect to receive the solution within 4 days after you receive the assignment.
- Again, we believe in reading git commit messages first before reviewing the code. This helps us understand how the code got matured and your thought process behind it.


## Use your own imagination to design the screens as you would like to.

**!! Happy Coding !!**
